## My Favourite Part

The best part about creating a client side application is that all the magic happens on the website without any server to store data. Figuring out how to make the app work for users without having any control over their sensitive information was very important which is why we decided to go with a non-custodial wallet.

Learning how to use the bchjs api and connect to the Bitcoin Cash Mainnet was really exciting and gave me exposure to working with cryptocurrency.

## Challenges

The biggest challenge in creating this app was figuring out how to get the Bitcoin wrapper working on the site so that users could import their existing bch wallet into the app or create a new wallet that could send and recieve currency. It was a great challenge since the documentation was not super extensive, but getting it working was a lot of fun.

## Next Steps

If I were to continue improving this project, the next steps would be to create my own api instead of the bchjs api which takes a small percantage of each transaction as a fee and also has a limit on the requests that can be made. If I wanted the app to be mroe scalable, I would need to create an API and a server that can manage multuiple users on the site at once.
