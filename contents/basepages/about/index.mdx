I am a full-stack developer based in Toronto with a background in digital marketing. I have always been a logical thinker that loves to solve problems in the most creative way possible. I will be documenting my development journey and sharing some of my favourite projects along the way so be sure to visit the blog and stay connected with me on social media.

When I'm not coding, you can find me making music in my bedroom studio. If you're interested in listening to some chill covers, check out my YouTube channel. I've always loved to create music as a way to express my creativity and bring joy to other people. Feel free to leave a comment to let me know if you enjoyed listening!
